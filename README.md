# pgn-parser
A simple Portable Game Notation parser to validate PGN files using PLY (python lexer-yacc) and count capture movements for every match.

Project developed during a course of Language Theory. This program validates a PGN file using a LALR parser by standard input.

Execution:

`python3 pgn_parser.py [PGN_file_name]`

Project instructions and some tests are given for a better understanding.
